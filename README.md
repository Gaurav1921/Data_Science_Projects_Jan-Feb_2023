# Data Science Projects Jan-Feb 2023

"Data_Science_Projects_Jan-Feb_2023" is a repository created for the members of the Sigma Club at NIT-T to contribute their data analytics projects. This repository provides a platform for members to showcase their skills and collaborate on projects related to data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and other data-driven fields. The projects submitted by members are reviewed by heads of the analytics domain of club and merged into the repository, making it a curated collection of high-quality data analytics projects.

Each repository created every two months includes a new set of projects contributed by members of the Sigma Club. The repository is named with the month and year in which it was created to keep track of when it was initiated. Members are encouraged to submit their projects as pull requests and participate in code reviews to ensure the quality and consistency of the projects. With each new repository, the Sigma Club continues to foster a collaborative environment where members can learn from each other and improve their skills in data analytics.
